Before you go on, have a large bowl, a spider (see tip below) and two colanders to hand, as well as a sink of cold water.\\nBring a huge saucepan of salted water to the boil. Stuff in about 250g/9oz spinach and leave for 30-45 seconds until just wilted, then scoop leaves into the bowl, draining off as much water as possible. Tip the spinach into a colander and plunge it into the sink. Swish the leaves until cool, then drain in the other colander. Repeat until all the spinach has been blanched.\\nUse your hands to squeeze as much water as possible from the spinach, then pile it onto a clean, threadbare tea towel (in two batches, if necessary). Twist the ends and squeeze out the rest of the water.\\nPut a large frying pan over a medium heat and add the clarified butter. Heat until light golden, then add black pepper and nutmeg. After about a minute, when it is gingerbread-coloured and smells nutty, add the spinach and capers and season. Lower the heat and toss the leaves until warmed through. Serve immediately.\\n",\

Gently drain the potatoes in a colander, but do not shake them or ruffle them up \'96 just leave them to drain and cool. Once there is no more steam coming off them, place on a tray in a single layer and put them in the fridge, uncovered, until ready to roast.\\nHeat oven to 200C/180C/gas 6 (or put them in when you turn it up for the turkey). Pour oil into a deep roasting tin to give an even layer of about 0.5cm. Place the tin in the oven for 5 mins to heat the oil, then remove from the oven. One at a time and working methodically (starting at one corner of the roasting tin and lining them up as you go) place each potato in the oil and use a spoon to turn it so it\'92s completely coated. Don\'92t worry about the oil cooling down too much. Once all the potatoes are in the tin in a single layer, not touching, place the tin in the oven and cook for 40 mins, undisturbed.\\nRemove from the oven and \'96 again, meticulously \'96 turn each potato. Return to the oven for 20 mins, then repeat the potato-turning process again. If, at this stage, your other side dishes allow you to, turn the oven up to 220C/200C fan/gas 7 and give the potatoes a final 20 mins. By now you should have potatoes that are everything a roastie should be: deep, golden and crunchy on the outside with an extra-fluffy middle \'96 just sprinkle with a little sea salt to serve.\\n",\

      "method": "Chill a saucer in the freezer, ready for checking the setting point of your jam. Wash the lemons and remove the top \'91button\'92 which would have been attached to the stalk. Put the lemons in a large saucepan with 2.5 litres water. Bring to the boil, then cover the pan and simmer for 2\'bd hrs or until the lemon skins are lovely and tender, and can be pierced easily with a fork.\\nWhen the lemons are cool enough to handle, remove from the saucepan. Measure the cooking liquid \'96 you\'92ll need 1.5 litres in total. If you don\'92t quite have this, make up the difference with water. If you have too much liquid, bring to the boil and reduce to the required amount.\\nHalve the lemons and remove the pips \'96 reserving the pips and any lemon juice that oozes out during the process. Cut the lemon peel and flesh into strips, as thick or thin as you like. Put all of this, including any juices, back into the pan. Put the pips in a small piece of muslin and tie up with string. Add this to the pan, as the pips will aid the setting process of the jam.\\nAdd the sugar and bring to the boil, stirring until it has completely dissolved. Boil rapidly for about 20 mins until setting point is reached. Test the setting point by dropping a little marmalade onto the chilled saucer, allowing it to cool for 1 min, then pushing gently with your finger. If the marmalade crinkles, the setting point is reached; if not, continue to boil and check again in a few mins.\\nLeave to cool for 10-15 mins (this will prevent the lemon shreds sinking to the bottoms of the jars), remove the muslin bag, then gently stir in one direction to disperse any scum (small air bubbles on the surface). Pour jam into warm sterilised jars and seal straight away.\\n",\
